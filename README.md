# Issue tracker

Issues have a title, description and one of three states: open, pending and closed. Once an issue is pending it cannot be set back to open, similarly if an issue is closed it cannot be set back to pending or open.
## Available Scripts

Install dependencies via `yarn install` in `server` and `client` directories:
### `cd ./client && yarn install && cd ../server && yarn install`

To run the app in the development mode run `yarn start` from `client` dir.
### `cd ./client && yarn start`
